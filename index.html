        <p>When Dana first meets Rufus on a Maryland plantation, he's drowning. She saves his life - and it will happen
            again and again.

            <br>

            <p>Neither of them understands his power to summon her whenever his life is threatened, nor the significance of
            the
            ties that bind them.</p>

            <br>

           <p> And each time Dana saves him, the more aware she is that her own life might be over before it's even begun.</p>
